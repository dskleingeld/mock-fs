prototype code for an experimental distributed filesystem inspired by google FS trying to improve the scaling in read and write throughput.

This prototyping code was written to explore the problem space and see if the solution could work. Therefore it is __not documented__.

The lessons learned here are used in my [Thesis](https://github.com/dvdsk/Thesis)
